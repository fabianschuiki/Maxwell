Maxwell Programming Language
============================

Root Section
------------
The root section of a file is the topmost level of statements, that is, such that are not enclosed
in any kind of block structure.

The root section may contain:
- import statements
- class declarations
- function declarations

Maxwell combines the concept of namespaces and classes. Therefore only global functions and class
declarations are allowed at root level. Global variables are forbidden.
