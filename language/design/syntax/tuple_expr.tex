\section{Tuple Expression}

\begin{verbatim}
tuple_expr : "(" tuple_arg ("," tuple_arg)+ ")"
tuple_arg  : expr | ident ":" expr
\end{verbatim}

A tuple is an ordered group of two or more expressions. Each field may have an
optional name and may be of an arbitrary type. It is possible to mix named and
anonymous fields in a tuple. If a tuple is assigned to another tuple, the named
fields are matched up first and the anonymous fields follow in the order that
they are defined.

\subsection{Examples}

\begin{verbatim}
(a) (1,2,3)
(b) (one: 1, two: 2, three: 3)
(c) (one: 1, 2, three: 3)
\end{verbatim}
