A \emph{primary expression} groups two types of expressions together: atomic
expressions which consist only of one token, and enclosed expressions which
consist of multiple tokens between two grouping symbols such as parentheses.
This makes primary epxressions very easy to parse, since they either consist of
only one token, or start with a symbol that is matched by another symbol at the
end.
