/** GENERICS */
//Maxwell supports generic types next to its powerful dynamic type.

//The following specifies a type array which has a specializable type T:
type array <T> { ... };

//Types can have a default value, e.g.:
type array <T = ~> { ... };

//The former requires the specification of T when the type is used:
a array <T: string>; //works
b array; //does not work, as the compiler doesn't know what type T is.

//The latter specifies a default type T, which allows it to be omitted:
a array <T: string>; //works
b array; //now also works, implicitly specifying b array <T: ~>
