\subsection{Array Literals}

An array literal is a constant, static array defined in source code. It is not intended to be modified and supports only a rather simplistic interface:

\begin{itemize}
  \item get (index Int) -> A
  \item length -> Int
\end{itemize}

This corresponds to the \em{#const_array} interface, which declares a function to access individual elements, and a function to obtain the overall length of the array.
