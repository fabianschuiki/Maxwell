/**
\namespace maxwell::serialization
Facilities that allow for convenient and efficient binary serialization.
The Encoder and Decoder interfaces provide an abstract means of reaading and
writing binary data. The VectorEncoder class is provided to encode data into
an std::vector that will resize as more data is serialized. The ArrayDecoder
class is provided to easily decode data from a binary stream.
