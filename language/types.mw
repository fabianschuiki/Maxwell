//Consider the following variables:
a int;
b double;

//The type operator resolves to the variable's type.
//Types are like C++ classes.
ta type = ?a; //resolves to the type "int"
tb type = ?b; //resolves to the type "double"

//The name operator resolves to the variable's name.
//Note that these things are evaluated at compile-time.
na string = #a; //resolves to "a"
nb string = #b; //resolves to "b"


//Consider the following useful function which dumps a variable to the console:
dump (x) {
	fmt.print(#x .. " = " .. x);
}

//The name operator will resolve not to the name of the function argument,
//but to the expression that was passed to it.
c int = 1;
dump(c);     //prints "c = 1"
dump(4 + 6); //prints "4 + 6 = 10"
