<h1>If Expression</h1>
<p>It should be possible to have complex if statements as expressions, similar to how cases are notated in mathematics.</p>
<code>a.doSomethingWith({0 if x == "null", 1 otherwise});</code>
<p>Or, in a more elaborate case:</p>
<code>var int x = getUserInput();
var String b = {
	"0" if x == 0,
	"1" if x == 1,
	">1" otherwise };</code>


<h1>"incase" Statement/Expression</h1>
<p>The <em>incase</em> keyword should introduce a construct that implements and extends the well-known <em>switch and case</em> statement. The keyword may be used as a statement, taking statements or blocks as case arguments; or as an expression, taking any expressions as case arguments. The construct allows a sequence of binary operator expressions with the same left hand side operand and optionally the same operator to be written in a compact manner.</p>
<code>var int x = getUserInput();
if (x == 0)
	doA();
if (x == 1)
	doB();
if (x == 2)
	doC();
</code>
<p>In the preceding code, all <em>if</em> statements share the same LHS operand and operator, namely <code>x ==</code>. Using the <code>incase</code> keword, these statements may be simplified to:</p>
<code>incase x == 0: doA(), 1: doB(), 2: doC();

// or easier to read on multiple lines
incase x ==
	0: doA(),
	1: doB(),
	2: doC();</code>

<p>In case the LHS is the same but the operator changes:</p>
<code>incase x == 0: doA(), &lt;= -1: doB(), &gt;= 1: doC();

// or easier to read on multiple lines
incase x
	== 0: doA(),
	&lt;= 1: doB(),
	&gt;= 1: doC();</code>

<p>To make it possible to contract <em>if/else if/else</em> constructs, the <code>otherwise</code> keyword allows for the <em>else</em> part:</p>
<code>incase x == 0: doA(), 1: doB(), otherwise: doC();</code>


<h1>Option Types</h1>
<p>The planned type inferrence strongly suggests the support of option types, i.e. a special type that is a set of actual types. This allows a variable to be expressed as being either of type "A or B".</p>
<code>var String|Error r = getUserInput();</code>

<h2>Implications</h2>
<p>One implication of option types is that it allows for very rigorous type checking. If <em>String</em> has a function <code>getLength()</code> and <em>Error</em> a function <code>getMessage()</code>, the statement…</p>
<code>r.getLength();
r.getMessage();</code>
<p>…will throw an error, since neither of the two functions is supported by both types. In case there is some powerful assumption logic in place, the following would work:</p>
<code>if (r isa String) {
	//In this scope, r is of type String.
	r.getLength();
}
if (r isa Error) {
	//In this scope, r is of type Error.
	r.getMessage();
}</code>



<h1>String Formatting</h1>
<p>In general, there should be a function that allows a string to be formatted by replacing special template characters (e.g. <em>%s</em>) with appropriate values from a value map or array. Syntactic sugar should be available to make this process as easy as possible:</p>
<code>var int x = 1;
var float y = 1.2345;
var String text = "We have an int %{x}, some float %{y} and a float as int %i{x}.";
</code>
<p>The last line of the snippet should automatically be converted to:</p>
<code>var String text = "We have an int %i, some float %f and a float as int %i.".format([x, y, x]);</code>



<h1>Nullable Types</h1>
<p>Variables with an object type should not automatically accept <code>null</code> or <code>nil</code> as a value, even if the C backend has nullable pointers for free. This enables the programmer to clearly distinguish functions that always return a value and those that may return null.</p>
<code>func loadWebsite -> (<span class="type">String|null</span>) { ... } //This function returns the contents of the website on success, or null if an error occurred.

var String google = loadWebsite(); //Fails to compile, since the variable mustn't be null.
var String|null google = loadWebsite(); //Works.</code>

<h2>Implications</h2>
<p>Combined with type inferrence and some powerful assumption logic, this allows for some nice error checking that may catch a lot of the classic <em>null-pointer dereferencing</em> issues at compile time:</p>
<code>//loadWebsite() as above
var any google = loadWebsite(); //Type detected to be String|null.

//The following will fail and prevent a null-dereferencing segfault…
var int length = google.length(); //…since no functions can be called on null.

//The following will work…
if (google == null)
	return;
var int length = google.length(); //…since the compiler assumes the variable to be of type String after the if-statement.</code>



<h1>Interfaces / Typeclasses</h1>
<p>Due to its generic nature, Maxwell only imposes those constraints on entity types that are vital for the program's integrity. Consider the following snippet of code:</p>
<code>func describeWeight(thing) {
	if (thing.weight &lt; 20)
		return "light";
	else
		return "heavy";
}</code>

<p>When compiling, Maxwell would infer the type of <code>thing</code> to be anything that has a <code>weight</code> property. Typeclasses allow the programmer to explicitly restrict a generic type to meet a minimal standard of functionality that is required. The function above may be written more explicitly:</p>
<code>//define a "weighable" object as something that has a weight assigned
typeclass #weighable { var any weight; };

//our function now describes the weight of something that is weighable
func describeWeight(thing #weighable) { ... }</code>

<p>Typeclasses look like a Twitter hashtag as they categorize an entity. Other definition syntaxes might look like:</p>
<code>typeclass colored { ... }
typeclass #colored { ... }

tag colored { ... }
tag #colored { ... }

interface colored { ... }
interface #colored { ... }</code>

<h2>Simple Example</h2>
<p>Having these hashtags helps improve the readability of Maxwell code and simplifies the task of analyzing what a certain snippet of code is doing. Consider the following snippet of code. For this section of the code, it is not important that <code>connection.receive()</code> returns a set of packets, but rather that it supports the <code>count()</code> and <code>get(var i)</code> functions, as they're required for the iteration.</p>
<code>//we've setup a network connection where we receive packets
var any packets #countable = connection.receive();

//we don't care that these are packets, we just want to iterate over them
for (var i = 0; i &lt; packets.count(); i++) {
	var any packet = packets.get(i);
	//... do something with it
}</code>

<h2>Nested Tags</h2>
<p>Tags become even more useful if they may be nested and defined across multiple hierarchy levels. Consider the following example, in which <code>list</code> may be any collection whose objects are <code>#named</code>:</p>
<code>typeclass #named { var name; }

//we want to process an collection of objects whose name we're going to require
var any list [#named] = connection.receive();
for (var obj in list) {
	console.print("received something called %{obj.name}\n");
	//...
}</code>

<p>Or the following example with objects:</p>
<code>typeclass #rgb { var r; var g; var b; }
typeclass #colored { var color; }

var any mesh #{color #rgb} = engine.getMesh();
mesh.color.r = 1.0;
mesh.color.g = 0.5;
mesh.color.b = 0.0;

//or more Maxwell-like:
{ c.r = 1.0; c.g = 0.5; c.b = 0.0; } where c = mesh.color;

//or even more Maxwell-like:
mesh.color.(r,g,b) = (1.0, 0.5, 0.0);</code>



<h1>In-case-null abbreviation</h1>
<p>In C and C++ you tend to do things like:</p>
<code>Person *p = fetchPerson();
return (p ? p->getName() : "unknown");</code>

<p>In Maxwell the following should be possible as an abbreviation, with the latter form to be preferred as it describes its operation better:</p>
<code>return (fetchPerson() ?? "unknown");
return (fetchPerson() or "unknown");</code>




<h1>Units</h1>
<p>Maybe adding units support for values would be nice?</p>
