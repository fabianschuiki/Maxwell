Maxwell Programming Language
============================

Overview
--------
There are two compilers in this repository. One is written in PHP in order to
provide the most basic Maxwell compiling capabilities. The other is written in
Maxwell itself and acts as a language development tool. Currently the compiler
written in Maxwell has to be compiled using the compiler written in PHP.
