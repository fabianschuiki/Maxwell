<h1>Maxwell In A Nutshell</h1>
<p>Maxwell aims to combine the expressive power of an interpreted language with the efficiency of a compiled one. C++ is efficient but changes to an existing type hierarchy are at least difficult. PHP is highly expressive but slow and while you're free to randomly alter the code structure it won't blow up until actual code execution. Today's compilers only leverage a minor amount of information inferable from source code, thus putting a lot of the bookkeeping burden on the programmer.</p>

<p>Maxwell tries to trade off compilation speed for an increase in abstraction and static checking. Generic programming and type inference allows the programmer to write minimalistic code which the compiler will try to make sense of during compile time. By strictling checking variable types and value ranges the compiler is able to understand the code at a low level and make assumptions or highlight errors. This means randomly changing stuff is as easy as in PHP, but will blow up during compile time enabling the programmer to immediately see and fix the errors introduced.</p>

<h2>Compilation Philosophy</h2>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Microprocessors are limited to a few instructions encoded in binary digits. The assembler language provides a means of writing these instructions in a human readable way, which are then translated to machine code (<strong>Assembler » Machine Code</strong>).</li>
		<li>C introduces structure, allowing the programmer to structure the program logic and memory, which then compiles to assembler (<strong>C » Assembler » Machine Code</strong>).</li>
		<li>Maxwell introduces abstraction, allowing the programmer to describe program logic in a generic way, which then compiles to C (<strong>Maxwell » C » Assembler » Machine Code</strong>).</li>
	</ul>
