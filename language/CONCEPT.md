Maxwell Programming Language
============================

Maxwell aims to combine the simplicity and flexibility of dynamically typed languages like PHP with the power and efficiency of statically typed languages like C++. The language always tends to assume the most generic case, giving maximum flexibility, but providing the possibility to further specify and narrow stuff down, giving maximum performance where required. Maxwell *in general steps out of your way, except when you explicitly ask it not to*. 

Operators
---------
- `..` is the concatenation operator. It should work on strings, arrays and other sequential collections of data.
